## Overview

We have creat a system that uses MOM as an integration platform. Our setup of MOM is done by setting up a
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) server on one of our servers. Specifically on www.mathiasbigler.com:15672.

The RabbitMQ instance runs in a Docker container instantiated
by this command: 
````
docker run -d -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 -p 5671:5671 --hostname my-rabbitmq --name my-rabbitmq-container rabbitmq:3-management
````
